# Highway Racer
Highway Racer is a fun and easy-to-play 2D car racing game. As a player, your main objective will be to avoid colliding with other cars and survive for as long as you can. During your drive, you might come across several different power-ups. Collecting them will provide you with an advantage, but keep in mind: **all power-ups are temporary**, so you will mostly have to rely on your driving skills in order to survive!

# How to play
### Singleplayer mode:
- Use arrow keys or 'WASD' keys to move your car in the desired direction.
- Other cars will be coming towards you from the opposite direction. To survive, you have to avoid colliding with them.
- Aside from cars, you might come across **power-ups** as well. Collecting them will grant you a **temporary** advantage.
- There are four types of power-ups in the game, and each of them will grant you a certain power.
- Only **1** power-up can be active at a time, so choose wisely.
- The longer you survive, the higher your score will be. Challenge your friends to see if they can beat your highest score!

### Multiplayer mode:
- In **Multiplayer mode**, the same general rules are applied. The only difference is that there will be **two** highways, one for each player.
- **Player 1:** Use 'WASD' keys to move your car.
- **Player 2:** Use arrow keys to move your car.
- In case one of the players crash, the other will be able to continue playing. In this mode, the main goal will be to **survive longer** than the other player.
- Invite a friend to play with you, and see which one of you is the best driver!
